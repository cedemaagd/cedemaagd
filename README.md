### Technical communications

[Universal Windows Platform Apps](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_01.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (CVAD) users
</br>**Goal**: Update and simplify installation instructions

In a customer support ticket, the CVAD user's deceptively complex request was for "an [application] installation process that works". In reviewing the pertinent page, I found not only outdated processes, but also opaque link text pointing to nonexistent pages, idiosyncratic terminology, and a "work-flow" that did neither, resulting in a help page that didn't help. I drafted SME-reviewed, DITA-determined text that fixed these errors and provided clarity to CVAD users. View times for the page dropped (because the process was no longer inscrutable), click-through rates to supporting pages rose, and Citrix received a gracious thank-you from the original requester.

[Using a Highlight Table to Show Specific Values](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_02.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Online students of Tableau Desktop/Tableau Online
</br>**Goal**: Educate and enable first-time users

Following a job-task analysis that enlightened me about how different users approach learning our software, the Tableau Curriculum team re-focused its online eLearning materials for multiple audiences. One aspect of that re-focus was a more nuanced approach to wooing new users. In the "Using a Highlight Table to Show Specific Values" lesson, I'm showing users of a legacy technology (spreadsheets) the same data in a multi-colored highlight table, closing the case for why Tableau is a better venue for seeing and understanding their data.

[Spatial Functions: MakePoint and MakeLine](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_03.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Classroom students of Tableau Desktop
</br>**Goal**: Inform experienced users

With each version update of Tableau, I ask myself the same questions for new features: *Who's the audience for this: new, intermediate or advanced (*i.e., Desktop I, II or III*) users?* For this pair of 2019.2 features, the audience was advanced; thus, the explanation in Desktop III was bare bones. I wrote just enough text to explain how the features work, clarified them in a table, gave an example in code‚Äîand that's it. No need to overwhelm new or intermediate users with a feature they're not ready for; and as for Tableau veterans, pedagogical pointers are all they need.

[New Feature Spotlight](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_04.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Current users of Tableau Desktop
</br>**Goal**: Inform experienced users/subscribers

For the "NFS" project, I worked with another writer and subject matter expert (SME) to produce PowerPoint decks informing current users, and subscribers to our online offerings, about new features in Tableau Desktop. For each new feature, the goal was to remind the user about an existing "pain point" regarding the product, then show how the new feature rectified the problem. Long-time Users got a sneak-peak at a new feature, and sales reps got another arrow in their quiver of sales materials.

[Set up your Xbox 360 E Console](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_05.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: New Xbox owners
</br>**Goal**: Enable first-time users

At Xbox Support, our primary goal was to get readers off the page and onto the gaming platform. Metrics software helped us identify underperforming articles. If a procedure was too long or confusing, we broke it up into separate parts. If a procedural explanation didn't work, we took it off-line and revised it until it did. In this example geared toward beginners opening the Xbox for the first time, I used minimal text, instead leaning on easily understood graphics to explain how to quickly get set up and get gaming.

[[MS-SSSO]: SQL Server System Overview](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_06.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Microsoft developers, MSDN users
</br>**Goal**: Maintain SQL Server protocol documentation

At Prowess Consulting, I worked on Microsoft's SQL Server Openness and Interoperability Principles Initiative (OIPI) team to routinely revise and publish protocol documentation for Microsoft developers using the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). I worked with publishing managers and other stakeholders to keep the documentation current via editing, revising procedures and tracking and resolving technical documentation issues (TDIs). Working on these docs gave me my first direct exposure to a computing language (SQL)‚Äîits structure and flow, dry elegance, and application in software.

### Marketing communications

[*NetWork* newsletter](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_07.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Electric utility employees
</br>**Goal**: Increase awareness of online fraud

Seattle City Light's Facilities, Security and Emergency Management (FSEM) division needed to inform its own employees without being overbearing or stilted, either of which could lead the busy staff to tune us out. But neither could we be too flip or familiar. In this newsletter piece, my goal was to persuade City Light employees to treat online and email security with conscious respect and do what City Light FSEM was asking. Coating the medicine with too much sugar would've been as counter-productive as issuing an edict. Whatever the advice imparted, the final text had to be firm but instructive.

[*Powerlines* blog](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_08.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Electric utility consumers
</br>**Goal**: Reassure our users

Sometimes it's necessary and useful to recast an internal piece for public consumption. Seattle City Light's *Powerlines* blog is just one of the utility's several public-facing online presences, and their premiere online venue for informing the public about who City Light employees are and what they do. In this blog post, I took the above *NetWork* newsletter example and re-cast it for public consumption, thereby showcasing an aspect of City Light that the public might not otherwise see. And while the public might not immediately associate "security" with their local utility, it's never wrong to remind them that security and safety always go together at Seattle City Light.

[It's your time to SHINE!](https://github.com/cedemaagd/cedemaagd/blob/main/cedemaagd_portfolio_09.pdf) *(writing sample)*
</br>**Audience**: Prospective online/in-person graduate students
</br>**Goal**: Persuade aspiring students to learn more

In 2016, I interviewed several alumni of Saint Leo University, a 16,000-student Catholic university 30 miles north of Tampa, Florida. The resulting articles were used by Saint Leo's admissions staff in recruitment publications that targeted prospective undergraduates and graduates seeking online and on-campus degrees. In each publication, the goal was to give prospective students stories with which they can identify. The underlying message was always the same: "A Saint Leo education can enable your success."
